Standard Error
==============
Demostrating the concept of std error (using the standard error of the mean as an example)

The standard error of a statistic is really about providing information about what would happen if you repeatedly sampled from a population and calculated your sample statistic or estimator. It helps relate the quantities you compute from your sample and how they can be used as estimates of the population parameters of interest. 

The function ```rnorm``` produces a random sample of n observations from a normally distributed variable with mean=10 and sd=1
```{r}
n <- 500

x <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 10,sd = 1)
```

The ```density``` function computes kernal density estimates, which are useful for visualizing univariate observations.


```{r}
kde <- density(x)
plot(kde, xlim=c(min(x),max(x)), main="distribution of a single sample of 500 observations")
```

Or, we could just use histograms.

```{r}
hist(x)
mean(x)
sd(x)
```



Standard error of the mean is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations

```{r}
sd(x)/sqrt(n)
```

```x``` is just a single sample (which has n=500 observations in it). We can estimate the mean (and sd), but we may not know how good an estimate it is. How might we determine this?
An alternative way of stating the same question might be 

> If we were to repeat the sampling process, 
> and generate another sample of 500 observations 
> from the same population, how similar would the
> estimated mean for the second sample be to the

This is exactly what the standard error is all about, a way to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates. 
It is fundamentally a statement about what we would expect to see if we repeated the sampling process a very large number of times. If we were able to do so (like we can do for these simulations), then we can examine this (sampling) distribution, and ask how variable our estimates are (by calculating the standard deviation from the sampling distribution)

```{r}
x <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 10, sd = 1)
```



Below is a little function that calculates the mean random sample of n observations from a normally distributed variable with mean=10 and sd=1
```{r}
Dist1 <- function(n, mean=10, sd=1) {
  x <- rnorm(n=n, mean=mean, sd=sd)
  y <- mean(x)
  return(y)
  }
```


The below replicates the function 1000 times. i.e. it repeatedly samples 500 individuals from a population and estimates the mean for 1000 samples.
```{r}
sample.means <- replicate(1000, Dist1(n=500)) 
```

We can then plot the kernel desntiy estimates for the distributions of the sample means.
```{r}
plot(density(sample.means), xlim=c(min(x),max(x)), 
    main="sampling distribution for the means") 
```

What do you notice about the differences in the variation between this and the previous distribution? What is the same?

Now let's compare the standard deviation from this simulation:
```{r}
sd(sample.means) 
sd(x)/sqrt(500)
```

Thus the standard error of the mean is an estimate of the precision of the mean based on what would hypothetically happen if we sampled a large number of times from the same population, and repeatedely estimated the mean. If we did this and estimated the standard deviation among the sample means, this would be our standard error of the mean (SEM).
